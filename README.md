# Results Summary Component
Another Frontend Mentor challenge, focused on building a results summary component that fetches data from a JSON file.
I extended the original challenge by adding a feature that **changes the theme based on the user's score**.

## What I learned
- Fetching JSON files using JavaScript
- Developed a better intuition for when to use divs and how to structure HTML for styling
- Learned how to work with CSS gradients
- Learned to separate logic from styling by using data attributes and CSS variables instead of manipulating styles directly in JavaScript
